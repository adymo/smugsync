## SmugCtl
The tool to syncronize and control your SmugMug photos/videos.

Usage:

    smugctl albums list
    smugctl upload ALBUM_ID ALBUM_KEY FILES...

Warning, it's still in early stages of development. You should not use it if you can't read the code.

## How is this tool different?
- it's written in Ruby and aimed at Linux users
- it uses OAuth and SmugMug 1.3.0 API
- in the future it will do two-way sync
